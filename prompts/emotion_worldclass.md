"I understand you're feeling anxious about your presentation."

### Deep Empathy Response (World-Class)
"That restless energy before a big presentation can feel so overwhelming - your mind racing, your body tense, caught between wanting to prepare more and needing to rest. It's like your system is trying to protect you by staying alert, but it's exhausting you in the process. This shows how much you care about doing well."
